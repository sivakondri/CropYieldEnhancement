# Crop Yield Enhancement

## Project Overview
The "Crop Yield Enhancement" project helps farmers maximize crop yields by recommending the best crops to plant based on soil and environmental conditions. The model, built using decision trees, suggests optimal crops and provides planting strategies to enhance productivity.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python
- **Framework:** Flask
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Model Development

### Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees

### Parameters
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Rainfall
- Soil pH

### Model Selection
Decision Trees were chosen for their high accuracy.

## Planting Strategies
For each recommended crop, we provide strategies on:
- Seed spacing

## Flask Deployment
A Flask web application allows users to input soil and environmental data to get crop recommendations and planting strategies.
